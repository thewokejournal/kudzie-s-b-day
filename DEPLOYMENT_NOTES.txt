FIXED ISSUES FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT
===================================

Problem: Black screen on Vercel deployment
Root Cause: The vite.config.ts had base: '/kudzie-s-bday/' configured for GitHub Pages

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. vite.config.ts
   - Changed base path from '/kudzie-s-bday/' to '/'
   - This ensures assets load correctly on Vercel's root domain

2. constants.ts
   - Updated all photo URLs to include leading slash (e.g., '/WhatsApp Image...')
   - Ensures images load from public directory correctly

3. vercel.json (NEW FILE)
   - Added Vercel configuration
   - Configured SPA routing with rewrites
   - Set correct build command and output directory

4. .vercelignore (NEW FILE)
   - Excludes unnecessary files from deployment

5. README.md
   - Added Vercel deployment instructions

DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR VERCEL:
-----------------------------

1. Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub

2. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in

3. Click "Add New Project"

4. Import your GitHub repository

5. Vercel will auto-detect the settings from vercel.json:
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Install Command: npm install

6. Click "Deploy"

7. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

8. Your app will be live at the provided Vercel URL!

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✅ Build succeeds without errors
✅ All images are copied to dist folder
✅ Asset paths use absolute paths from root (/)
✅ Preview server runs correctly
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors

The app should now deploy successfully to Vercel with all images and functionality working correctly!
